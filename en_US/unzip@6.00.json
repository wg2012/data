In contrastto most of the competing utilities, unzip removes the 12 additional header bytes of encrypted entries from the compressed size numbers.  Therefore, compressed size and compression ratio  fig\u2010ures are independent of the entry's encryption status and show the correct compression performance.  (The complete size of the encrypted compressed data stream for zipfile entries is reportedby the more verbose zipinfo(1) reports, see the separate manual.)  When no zipfile is specified (that is, the complete command is simply ``unzip -v''), a diagnostic screen is printed.
