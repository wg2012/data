Therefore, compressed size and compression ratio  fig\u2010ures are independent of the entry's encryption status and show the correct compression performance.  (The complete size of the encrypted compressed data stream for zipfile entries is reportedby the more verbose zipinfo(1) reports, see the separate manual.)
